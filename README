<h1> Spotify Clone </h1>
<p>This is a simple clone of Spotify without using API . In it I used JS to do functionality such as 
<ul>
<li>Play</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>Forward</li>
<li>Backward</li>
</ul>
In this project , UI was made using CSS3 and HTML which was made to be similar to spotify but with a little bit of creativity.
<h3>Coding Language Used In this are :</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JS</li>
</ul>
